\title{Building augmented data for multi-state models: the \code{msmtools} package}
\description{
\code{msmtools} introduces a fast and general method for restructuring classical longitudinal datasets
into \emph{augmented} ones. The reason for this is to facilitate the modeling of longitudinal data
under a multi-state framework using the \code{msm} package.
It also provides two graphical goodness-of-fit tools on estimated survival and prevalences
to carry out model assessment under Markov assumption.
